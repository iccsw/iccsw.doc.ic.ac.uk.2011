### <a name="learning"></a> The Future of Machine Learning

The past few decades has seen continuous progress in machine learning.
But are you happy abut the progress? Do you want to continue like this?
What do you think its future will look like?

The panel discussion will start with a brief overview of machine
learning given by [Prof. Stephen
Muggleton](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~shm/). We will then hear from our
panellists about their views on their sub-area: “How a particular
sub-area has been progressing?”, “What are the main challenges and
bottlenecks of that sub-area?”, “What are the interaction among various
sub-areas within machine learning?”. Along the progress of machine
learning techniques, their potential applications in the many fields of
computer science including software engineering are still being unfold.
For those of you who do not work on machine learning, you may still be
interested to see whether machine learning techniques can be potentially
applied to your area. After hearing opinions from panellists, we will
open the discussions to audiences and encourage you to ask questions to
our panellists. We are looking forward to hear your opinions.

Confirmed panellists:

* [Stephen Muggleton](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~shm/) (Inductive Logic
  Programming: Logic-based Machine Learning)
* [Aldo Faisal](http://faisallab.com/) (Biological and Computational
  Learning)
* [Alessandra Russo](http://www-dse.doc.ic.ac.uk/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/ar3)
  (Applying Machine Learning techniques to Software Engineering)
* [Daniel Roy](http://danroy.org/) (Statistical Machine Learning)
* [Artur Garcez](http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~aag/) (Neural-Symbolic
  Computation)

### <a name="engineering"></a> Software Engineering in the Age of Multi-Scale Computing

The last decade has seen the emergence of new hardware platforms,
ranging from multicore processors to large-scale data centers, which
provide an abundance of computational resources and a high degree of
parallelism. These platforms already benefit applications with a great
amount of inherent concurrency, through data-processing systems such as
MapReduce. One can view these technologies as forming levels within a
new, global computing platform. At the same time, we see a radical
growth of mobile platforms and pervasive computing. According to some
estimates, there should 1 billion mobile devices connected to the
internet by 2013. In few years time, the number of mobile devices
connected to the internet outnumbers the number of connected computers.

How will this evolution change the face of software engineering? Will
the existing software development approaches cope with the changing
requirements or do we need an entirely new ideas? Will the concept of
desktop computer survives this decade? Is this the fall of the PC? You
will have a chance to discuss all these questions with researchers and
engineers from Google, company which already changed the face of
computing. We also encourage you to come up and ask you own questions.
We look forward to hear you opinion.
