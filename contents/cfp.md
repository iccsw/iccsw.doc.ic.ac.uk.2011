## Overview

The workshop comprises of three different tracks, namely the *Technical
Track*, the *Discussion Track* and *Gone in 120 Seconds*, as detailed
below.

### Technical Track

This track is a general computing track for both theoretical and applied
approaches.

Areas of interest for the technical track cover all fields of research
in computer science, including (but not limited to) the following:

* Computer Systems 
* Software Engineering
* Logic and Artificial Intelligence
* Theory of Computational Systems
* Verification and Model Checking
* Adaptive and Embedded Systems
* Visual Information Processing
* Networks and Communications
* Programming Languages

### Discussion Track

This track includes multiple discussion panels on current topics in
computer science and its surrounding fields.

The goal of the discussion track is to stimulate engaging and
thought-provoking discussions about promising areas of interest, whether
or not research is yet in progress. Submissions should contain limited
technical details and present a (possibly provocative) standpoint.

Current discussion topics include:

* The Future of Machine Learning
* Software Engineering in the Age of Multi-Scale Computing

We invite students to nominate additional topics for a discussion panel
that they are willing to chair.

### Gone in 120 Seconds

The workshop plans to include a "two-minute madness" session at the
start of the event. In this session, participants are given a two-minute
opportunity to speak about their work.

The hope is that these short presentations will drum up interest in the
presenter's work and encourage more people to view the presenter's later
talk or come and visit their poster.

## Guidelines

We invite submissions to either track. Since the aim of the workshop is
to provide a venue for early-stage researchers to discuss their ongoing
research, we require each submission for the technical track not to
exceed 6 pages in [LNCS
style](http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). Each student
submitting a paper will be asked to review at least one other submission
from his or her area of expertise.

For the discussion track, we invite authors to submit topics for
discussion as well as replies to topics - these should take the form of
an (up to 2-page) extended abstract providing a creative response to a
featured topic.

Participants wishing to partake two-minute madness session are requested
to submit a short 2-slide presentation when sending their camera-ready
manuscript to the conference chairs.

Submission of papers, replies, and 120-second slides should be done via
[EasyChair](http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccsw2011).
Submission and proposals for topics of discussion should be
[emailed](mailto:iccsw@imperial.ac.uk) directly to the steering
committee.

## Proceedings

The proceedings will be provided to the participants in electronic
format at the time of the workshop. 

Depending on the quality of submissions, a selection may be published in
a post-proceedings volume as a technical report of the Department of
Computing, Imperial College London.
