Research in AI has built upon the tools and techniques of many different
disciplines, including formal logic, probability theory, decision
theory,
management science, linguistics and philosophy. However, the application
of
these disciplines in AI has necessitated the development of many
enhancements
and extensions. Among the most powerful of these are the methods of
computational logic.

I will argue that computational logic, embedded in an agent cycle,
combines
and improves upon both traditional logic and classical decision theory.
I will
also argue that many of its methods can be used, not only in AI, but
also in
ordinary life, to help people improve their own human intelligence
without the
assistance of computers.

[Professor Robert Anthony Kowalski](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~rak/) is a
Senior Research Investigator and
Emeritus Professor of Computational Logic at the Department of Computing
of
the Imperial College London. Professor Kowalski is recognized for his
contributions to logic for knowledge representation and problem solving,
including his pioneering work on automated theorem proving and logic
programming.

Building products for Google-scale presents some unique challenges in
the software development and operational spheres. Through exploring
techniques relating to design, development, configuration, deployment
and monitoring the talk will describe how Google delivers high
availability products with low latency to millions of customers
worldwide.

[Ollie Cook](https://plus.google.com/116630233175189944888) is a site
reliability manager at Google, managing the operational teams supporting
Google Calendar and real-time communications. His teams focus on product
and system availability, monitoring, capacity planning and deployment.
Prior to joining Google in 2011, Ollie was the technology services
manager at Betfair, an online gambling provider, specialising in
low-latency trading systems, and deployment and configuration management
of their global computing footprint.
