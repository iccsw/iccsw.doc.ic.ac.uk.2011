The 2011 Imperial College Computing Student Workshop aims to provide an
international forum for doctoral students to discuss a range topics that
are current in computer science research.

The workshop welcomes all research students in the field of computer
science from all around Europe.

The inaugural workshop aims at bringing together students at different
levels of their graduate studies. The workshop offers a traditional
track featuring technical papers and a discussion session focused on
current topics in computer science.

The workshop aims to:

* offer research students the opportunity to submit and present their
  research at an internationally-renowned institution; 
* provide PhD students with the experience of organising a workshop,
  including reviewing papers by other students;   
* provide a forum for open discussion of topics including those outside
  the current focus of research; 
* allow students to network with those from other institutions as well
  as to learn about current research at other universities.
